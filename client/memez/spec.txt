1. create a login screen
 - the user only needs to write down his name. check user store to verify that the user exists (in mock).

2. after login, navigate to Feed
3. add a "like" like (same as facebook)
4. when displaying a post, display number of likes
5. when clicking the likes number, show a dialog with all the users that liked this post (can use material design dialog or primeng or vanilla) (MODAL)

what you need:
1. login view component
2. login store (hold current user info - username, password...)
3. Like store

entity stores
- users
- posts
- likes

view stores
- feed store
- userprofile store
- login store



next lesson spec:
1. create server-side BE with node and express
2. create GET API endpoints - getUsers, getPosts, getLikes, Login
3. return Mock data from the server
4. make POST API endpoints - createUser, createPost, createLike
5. create mongo db with collections: users, posts, likes  (official mongodb npm package)

FE:
6. create createUser, createPost, createLike functions in the adapters and stores.


FE bonus :
make another BaseAdapter that saves and loads the data from localstorage.
